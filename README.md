Flatpak Manifest for AppStream CLI
==================================

This repository contains the Flatpak manifest for the `appstreamcli` utility for
deployment via Flathub.
AppStream is a collaborative effort for making machine-readable software metadata
easily available to programs that need it.

The Flatpak bundle provides the AppStream command-line utility to process and verify
AppStream metadata (catalog & metainfo files), as well as the `appstreamcli compose`
subcommand to generate catalog metadata from metainfo files.

To learn more about AppStream, please visit the project's website at [github.com/ximion/appstream](https://github.com/ximion/appstream).
