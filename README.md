Flatpak Manifest for AppStream CLI
==================================

This repository contains the Flatpak manifest for the `appstreamcli` utility for
deployment via Flathub.
AppStream is a specification and set of tools to make machine-readable software metadata easily available
to programs that need it (e.g. software centers, firmware/driver updaters, font installers, etc.).
It also allows software authors to provide relevant user-centric information (e.g. a translated description,
screenshots, etc.) about their software in advance, so potential users can make an informed decision on
whether they want to install it.

The Flatpak bundle provides the AppStream command-line utility to process and verify
AppStream metadata, as well as the `appstreamcli compose` subcommand to generate
catalog metadata from metainfo files.
